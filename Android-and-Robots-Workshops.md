Welcome to the XinCheJian Androids & Robots wiki!

# Why use Android for robotics?

* Built-in hardware is relatively cheap and powerful (GPS, accelerometers, Bluetooth, camera)
* Built-in processing power is sufficient to do high-level processing (vision)
* Easy-to-use development environment
* Compact size, built-in battery
 
# What you'll need to develop Android apps

* A MacOS X (Intel), Linux (x86 or x86_64) or Windows laptop
* An Android phone (2.1-update1 +) with the USB cable (Bluetooth, camera, accelerometers functions)
* The Android SDK for your platform
* Eclipse (3.6)
* The Eclipse extension for Android
* OEM USB (development) driver for your Android phone
* Git client and Eclipse extension for Git
* An account on github.com and access to [[https://github.com/xinchejian/XinCheJian-Workshops]]
