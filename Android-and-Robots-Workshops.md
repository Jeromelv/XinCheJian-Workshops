* Built-in processing power is sufficient to do high-level processing (vision)
* Easy-to-use development environment
* Compact size, built-in battery
 
# What you'll need to develop Android apps

* A MacOS X (Intel), Linux (x86 or x86_64) or Windows laptop
* An Android phone (2.1-update1 +) with the USB cable (Bluetooth, camera, accelerometers functions)
